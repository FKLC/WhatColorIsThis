# WIP: *What color is this*
As a colorblind person, I sometimes look at some graphs, but can't figure out which color is which. This is a browser extension that uses the new [EyeDropper API](https://github.com/WICG/eyedropper-api) to tell you what color the pixel you selected is. It comes with 16 basic colors, but if you want to go even simpler (for example, just green and red), you can use only a subset of those 16 colors. Note that there are other alternatives that change the way the website looks, removing the need for this, but I don't want my colors to be adjusted, so I made this.
